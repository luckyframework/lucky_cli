# LuckyCli

A Crystal library for creating and running tasks

## Installing the CLI

1.  Install [homebrew](http://brew.sh)
2.  Run `brew tap luckyframework/lucky`
3.  Run `brew install lucky`

Run `which lucky` from the command line to make sure it is installed.

**If you're generating a Lucky web project, [install the required dependencies](https://luckyframework.org/guides/installing.html#install-required-dependencies). Then run `lucky init {project_name}`**

## Using LuckyCli in a non-Lucky web app

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  lucky_cli:
    github: luckyframework/lucky_cli
```

Create a file `tasks.cr` at the root of your project

```crystal
require "lucky_cli"

# Using `lucky` from the command line will do nothing if you forget this
LuckyCli::Runner.run
```

## Creating tasks

In `tasks.cr`

```crystal
class App::SendDailyNotifications < LuckyCli::Task
  # What this task does
  banner "Send notifications to users"

  # Name is inferred from class name ("app.send_daily_notifications")
  # It can be overriden if desired:
  #
  #    name "app.send_daily_notifications"

  def call
    # Code that sends notifications to all your users
    puts "Sent daily notifications!"
  end
end

# LuckyCli::Runner.run is below this
```

This will create a task that can be run with `lucky app.send_daily_notifications`.
The name is inferred from the name of the class unless explicitly set with `name`.

You can see all available tasks by running `lucky --help`
